# Shop Hours Demo
A demo UI for setting a shop's operating hours using React.

## Notes
These are some things I'd do to improve the interface, but chose to forgo in the interest of time.
* For better usability, the 'From' and 'To' time fields should ideally be text boxes with augosuggest. The current select boxes are likely not flexible enough (no half-hour or 15-minute intervals).
* Add icons (e.g. + icon on the 'Add' button)
* Consider using a time library (such as Moment.js) to hadle formatting times for localization.
* Add aria attributes for better accessibility.
